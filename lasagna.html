        <h3> Instructions</h3>

            <li>Layer a third of the remaining tomato sauce over the lasagna noodles and then layer half of the ricotta mixture. Layer half of the chicken over the ricotta and then spread a third of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat this pattern: noodles, sauce, ricotta cheese, chicken, and mozzarella cheese.
